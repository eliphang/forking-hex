# Forking Hex ðŸ”±â¬¢â¬¡
Find a move that connects two sides of the hex board and win crypto.

## Background
Forking Hex is based on the game Hex. The moves are the same. The innovation of Forking Hex is the addition of *forking*.

## Forking
Anyone (including new players who haven't previously made moves) can make a move on any *open* position. Additional moves can be made in response to any open position, creating forks.

Thus, Forking Hex is loosely a team game, with players able to join a team that seems to be winning or leave a team when the situation seem hopeless. Players can even play on both sides of the same game.

## Rules
### Game creation
Anyone can create a new game, specifying the size of the board
